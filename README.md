# Barista-Panic
A 2D game where you serve coffee by day and fight robots by night!

This was a game made in my Senior year which I took all the way to the regionals for SkillsUSA and placed first place with my partner!
We didn't decide to go on to State so we didn't end up fixing some of the odd ends of the game so it's still a tad bit buggy but if you're
wanting to try out the game still, you can download it using one of the last two files labeled "Barista Panic! Mac" if you have a Mac and
"Barista Panic! Windows" if you have Windows.
